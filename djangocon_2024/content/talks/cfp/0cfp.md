Thank you to everyone who showed interest and submitted their talks and workshops for DjangoCon Europe 2024, set to take place in the beautiful city of Vigo, Spain. The Call for Proposals (CFP) officially closed at 23:59 (UTC) on February 29th, marking the end of an exciting submission phase.

We have been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and diversity of the proposals received, covering a wide range of both technical and non-technical topics. It's inspiring to see such vibrant participation from both new and seasoned speakers, reflecting the inclusive and supportive spirit of the Django community.

**What Happens Next?**
