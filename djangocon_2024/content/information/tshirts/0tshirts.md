We are still drawing up the best t-shirts for you! In the meanwhile, you can already purchase them together with your ticket.
 
We worry about sustainability, do our t-shirts are made from organic materials. And to avoid producing t-shirts in excess, we will just produce enough t-shirts to fulfil the orders that we receive. Therefore, we will have two distinct types of orders:
 
* T-shirts purchased until May 10 will be provided during the check-in at the venue: €25
* T-shirts purchased after May 11 will be mailed after the conference: €35 (inc. international shipping flat fee)
* T-shirts sold with online tickets will be mailed after the conference: €35 (inc. international shipping flat fee)
